## Inspiration
I created this project because I wanted to create a simplified version of film-related websites. I came up with this idea by browsing portals about this subject and watching how much information there is that does not matter to me. While browsing through these types of sites, the most important were reviews sent by users. So I created this web application that provides basic information about the film and user reviews.
